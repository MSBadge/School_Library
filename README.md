"# School_Library" 

Creat Django project core in School_Library already created folder
Create module for Books and define in admin.py file created through books app
Basic CRUD operation perform using Class Base View on django application
Then creat application API using REST API 
In books app create API folder to store API related programmes like serializers file
This REST API povide browseble API for easy to understand for developing but befor deploy we need to code default permission classes
For developing Django provide sqlite database but I change PostgreSQL as required but stay on sqlite for better understanding the programm


Here API are create of this application so we can use this to any foldable application
